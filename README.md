![Uber Analytics](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Uber+Pickup+Visualization) <!-- Add actual image path later -->
Analysis of 1.5 million Uber pickups from August 2014 in New York City, revealing key patterns in ridership behavior and operational insights.

## üîç Key Findings

### ‚è∞ Temporal Patterns
- **Peak pickup time**: 18:30 (90 pickups in 15-min interval)
- **Lowest activity**: 03:15 AM
- **Busiest day**: August 7, 2014 (32,759 pickups)
- **Weekly pattern**: 
  - Thursday = Highest ridership 
  - Sunday = Lowest ridership

### üöó Service Analysis
- **Top performing base model**: B02617
- **All base models**:
  | Code      | Service Name   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### üîß Tools Used
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from geopy import distance
‚ö° Key Processing Steps
python
# Convert to datetime
df['Date/Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date/Time'])

# Create 15-min bins
time_bins = [0, 15, 30, 45, 60]
df['Time Segment'] = pd.cut(df['Date/Time'].dt.minute, 
                            bins=time_bins, 
                            labels=['00-15', '15-30', '30-45', '45-60'])

# Analyze peak periods
peak_hour = df.groupby(df['Date/Time'].dt.hour).size().idxmax()
üìà Insights Summary
Daily pattern: Evening commute (17:00-18:30) = Critical demand period

Weekly pattern: 22% higher ridership on Thursdays vs Sundays

Top performer: Base B02617 handles 31% of total rides

Operational recommendation: Boost supply during 16:00-19:00 on weekdays
